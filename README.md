## Features

- üîã Reads data from attached sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity)  
- üåê Connects to Wi-Fi and an MQTT broker  
- üì° Publishes sensor readings to configurable MQTT topics  
- üîÑ Supports OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates via PlatformIO  
- üîß Simple configuration via `secrets.h`, keeping credentials out of source control  

---

## Prerequisites

- ESP32 development board  
- USB cable for power and USB uploads  
- [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/) installed  
- An MQTT broker (public or private)  
- (Optional) CLion with PlatformIO plugin or VS Code with PlatformIO extension  

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darthshadoww/esp32-sensor-project.git
   cd esp32-sensor-project
   ```
2. If starting from an existing local folder, initialize Git and link to remote  
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/darthshadoww/esp32-sensor-project.git
   git branch -M main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. Copy the example secrets file  
   ```bash
   cp include/secrets.example.h include/secrets.h
   ```
2. Open `include/secrets.h` and fill in your credentials:  
   ```cpp
   #pragma once

   // Wi-Fi settings
   #define WIFI_SSID    "your_ssid"
   #define WIFI_PASS    "your_password"

   // MQTT settings
   #define MQTT_SERVER  "broker.hivemq.com"
   #define MQTT_PORT    1883
   #define MQTT_USER    "mqtt_user"
   #define MQTT_PASS    "mqtt_pass"

   // OTA update
   #define OTA_PASSWORD "ota_update_password"
   ```
3. Ensure `include/secrets.h` is listed in `.gitignore` so it never gets committed.

---

## Building & Uploading

- **USB Upload**:  
  ```bash
  pio run --environment esp32dev --target upload
  ```
- **OTA Upload**:  
  ```bash
  pio run --environment ota --target upload
  ```

---

## Usage

1. After flashing, the ESP32 connects to your Wi-Fi network.  
2. It then connects to the MQTT broker.  
3. Sensor data is published periodically to topics such as:  
   - `sensors/temperature`  
   - `sensors/humidity`  
4. To view logs, run:  
   ```bash
   pio device monitor --environment esp32dev
   ```
